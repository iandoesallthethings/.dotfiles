# Ian's Dotfiles

Trying out this whole bare github repo thing. 

It's a mix of [this](https://d2weber.github.io/DougTyped/posts/dotfiles-under-control/) and a few other articles.

`dotfiles` is aliased to `git dotfiles $@` for easy management.

## Getting started
Just pull this repo straight in to `~/`. You might have to backup existing files first.
